## Technique Information
* Technique title: DetectCuckooNamedPipe
* Technique category: Sandbox Evasion
* Technique description: Cuckoo is an open-source automated malware analysis system that facilitates dynamic analysis by running suspicious files within isolated virtual environments. Communication between the analysis host and the virtualized guest is established through a specific named pipe: `\\.\pipe\cuckoo`. Malware executed inside the guest system may exploit this implementation detail to detect the analysis environmentâ€”by attempting to connect to or wait for the pipe, the malware can infer that it is being monitored.

This detection method bears resemblance to the [https://unprotect.it/technique/checking-pipe/](Checking Pipe) technique, although it relies on a different API or implementation nuance to identify the sandbox. This particular evasion tactic was observed in a real-world malware sample (SHA-256: c4692372e62ead639ec700883b4da4805809612a4d0c40dfca59c4854447ced0), highlighting its practical use in the wild.
