2 - Title of the techniques to modify

Evasion using direct Syscalls

3 - New Description (if required)

This technique can also be used for sandbox evasion. Some sandboxes log only higher-level WinAPI or NT API calls, but do not monitor or hook syscalls (or sysenters). 
Sandboxes that are missing these events will not see these calls. 
To combat this technique, ensure your sandboxes are able to log/hook syscalls and kernel function calls.
