## Technique Information
* Technique Title: **U1430 - ScrubCrypt**
* Technique category: **Packers**
* Technique description: 

ScrubCrypt is a malware obfuscation and encryption framework, derived from the earlier JLaive Batchfuscator crypter. It is designed to aid cybercriminals in evading detection and analysis by using a variety of techniques to conceal and protect the malicious software.

ScrubCrypt is advertised on cybercrime forums to employ encryption, code morphing, and (allegedly) polymorphism to create obfuscated malware payloads that are challenging to reverse-engineer and detection.

The Batch files generated by ScrubCrypt contain a Base64 encoded, AES-128-CBC encrypted and gzip compressed payload, which is executed / reflectively loaded.

## Detection rules

See included YARA rule SI_CRYPT_ScrubCrypt_BAT_Jan24.yar, detects obfuscated Batch files generated by ScrubCrypt.
