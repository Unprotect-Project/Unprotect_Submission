## Technique Information

- Technique Category: Packers
- Technique Tags: Huan, Software Packing, Defense Evasion
- Technique General Detail:

```
Huan is a software packer designed to obfuscate binary files and evade static analysis techniques. By modifying headers, sections, and import tables, it complicates reverse engineering efforts. The packer introduces custom relocations and dynamically fixes the Import Address Table (IAT) at runtime.
